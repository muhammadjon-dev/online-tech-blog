Developed a fully functional tech blog platform using Django, featuring user authentication,
content management, and dynamic routing. Inspired by websites like TechCrunch, I developed my
own tech blog platform to create a similar online space for tech enthusiasts.
* Utilized Django, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQLite for the project's development, and
designed custom templates for the project.
* Implemented user authentication and authorization for writers and readers.
* Overcame design challenges by creating custom and standardized templates to achieve the
desired look and feel.
* Created a tech blog platform to share and discuss the latest tech trends, news, and insights,
fostering a vibrant online tech community.
